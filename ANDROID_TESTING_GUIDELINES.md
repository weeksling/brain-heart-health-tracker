# Android Testing Guidelines for Cursor Background Agents

## Overview
This document outlines the Android testing capabilities available to Cursor background agents and provides guidelines for effective testing of Android applications in the containerized environment.

## Docker Environment Capabilities

### Available Tools in Container
The Dockerfile provides a comprehensive Android development environment including:
- **Android SDK** with multiple API levels (31-34)
- **Android Emulator** with system images for testing
- **Build Tools** (Gradle, Android build tools)
- **Node.js & React Native CLI** for React Native development
- **Expo CLI** for Expo-based development
- **Java 17** for Android development

### Pre-configured Android Virtual Device (AVD)
- **Device Name**: `test_device`
- **API Level**: Android 34 (latest)
- **ABI**: x86_64 (for performance in virtualized environments)
- **Features**: Google APIs enabled

## Testing Capabilities

### ✅ What Cursor Background Agents CAN Do

#### 1. Build Testing
- **Gradle builds**: `./gradlew build`, `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- **React Native builds**: `npm run android`, `npx react-native run-android`
- **APK generation**: Automated APK creation and validation
- **Build error detection**: Identify compilation issues, dependency problems
- **Lint checks**: Run Android lint and detect code quality issues

#### 2. Static Analysis
- **Code quality checks**: ESLint, Android Lint, Checkstyle
- **Security scanning**: Basic static analysis for common vulnerabilities
- **Dependency auditing**: Check for outdated or vulnerable dependencies
- **Performance analysis**: Basic performance metrics from build output

#### 3. Unit and Integration Testing
- **JUnit tests**: Run Android unit tests
- **Espresso tests**: Basic UI testing (limited by headless environment)
- **Jest tests**: JavaScript unit tests for React Native
- **Integration tests**: Test component integration without UI

#### 4. Emulator-based Testing (Limited)
- **Emulator startup**: Launch Android emulator in headless mode
- **App installation**: Install APK on emulator
- **Basic app launch**: Start app and detect immediate crashes
- **Log analysis**: Monitor logcat for errors and crashes
- **Network testing**: Test network connectivity and API calls

#### 5. Automated Validation
- **APK validation**: Verify APK structure and manifest
- **Permission checks**: Validate requested permissions
- **Resource validation**: Check resource files and references
- **Configuration testing**: Test different screen sizes and orientations

### ❌ What Cursor Background Agents CANNOT Do

#### 1. Visual Testing Limitations
- **Screenshot comparison**: Cannot capture or compare screenshots
- **UI visual validation**: Cannot verify visual appearance
- **Color/font testing**: Cannot validate visual design elements
- **Animation testing**: Cannot test complex animations

#### 2. User Interaction Testing
- **Touch interaction**: Cannot simulate complex touch gestures
- **User flows**: Cannot test multi-step user journeys
- **Accessibility testing**: Limited accessibility validation
- **Usability testing**: Cannot assess user experience

#### 3. Hardware-specific Testing
- **Camera testing**: Cannot test camera functionality
- **GPS/Location**: Cannot test location-based features
- **Sensors**: Cannot test accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.
- **Bluetooth/NFC**: Cannot test device connectivity features

#### 4. Performance Testing (Limited)
- **Memory profiling**: Limited memory usage analysis
- **Battery testing**: Cannot test battery consumption
- **Real-world performance**: Cannot test on actual devices

## Best Practices for Android Testing with Cursor Agents

### 1. Test Strategy
```bash
# Build verification
./gradlew clean build

# Unit tests
./gradlew test

# Basic app functionality
./gradlew installDebug
adb shell am start -n com.yourapp/.MainActivity

# Check for crashes
adb logcat | grep -i "crash\|error\|exception"
```

### 2. Emulator Testing Workflow
```bash
# Start emulator (headless)
emulator -avd test_device -no-window -no-audio -no-snapshot

# Wait for device to be ready
adb wait-for-device

# Install and test app
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.yourapp/.MainActivity

# Monitor for 30 seconds
timeout 30 adb logcat | grep -E "(ActivityManager|System.err|AndroidRuntime)"
```

### 3. Automated Testing Scripts
Create scripts that agents can run:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-android-app.sh

set -e

echo "Starting Android app testing..."

# 1. Build the app
echo "Building app..."
./gradlew assembleDebug

# 2. Run unit tests
echo "Running unit tests..."
./gradlew test

# 3. Start emulator
echo "Starting emulator..."
emulator -avd test_device -no-window -no-audio &
EMULATOR_PID=$!

# 4. Wait for emulator
adb wait-for-device
sleep 10

# 5. Install app
echo "Installing app..."
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# 6. Launch app
echo "Launching app..."
adb shell am start -n com.yourapp/.MainActivity

# 7. Check for crashes
echo "Monitoring for crashes..."
timeout 30 adb logcat | grep -E "(FATAL|AndroidRuntime)" || echo "No crashes detected"

# 8. Cleanup
kill $EMULATOR_PID
echo "Testing completed"
```

### 4. Integration with CI/CD
```yaml
# Example configuration for cursor agents
test_android:
  steps:
    - name: Build Android App
      run: ./gradlew assembleDebug
    
    - name: Run Unit Tests
      run: ./gradlew test
    
    - name: Basic Emulator Test
      run: |
        emulator -avd test_device -no-window &
        adb wait-for-device
        adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
        adb shell am start -n com.yourapp/.MainActivity
        sleep 10
        adb logcat -d | grep -E "(FATAL|AndroidRuntime)" || echo "App launched successfully"
```

## Error Detection Capabilities

### 1. Build Errors
- Compilation failures
- Missing dependencies
- Resource conflicts
- Manifest errors

### 2. Runtime Errors
- Application crashes on startup
- ClassNotFoundException
- OutOfMemoryError
- Network connectivity issues

### 3. Performance Issues
- Long build times
- Large APK sizes
- Memory leaks (basic detection)

## Limitations and Workarounds

### 1. Visual Testing
**Limitation**: Cannot validate UI appearance
**Workaround**: Focus on functional testing and structural validation

### 2. Complex User Interactions
**Limitation**: Cannot simulate complex user flows
**Workaround**: Test individual components and use unit tests for business logic

### 3. Hardware Features
**Limitation**: Cannot test device-specific features
**Workaround**: Mock hardware dependencies and test logic separately

## Recommendations

### 1. Focus on What Works
- Prioritize build validation and unit testing
- Use emulator for basic functionality testing
- Implement comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. Complement with Manual Testing
- Use agent testing for initial validation
- Perform manual testing for UI/UX validation
- Combine automated and manual testing strategies

### 3. Continuous Improvement
- Monitor test results and improve test coverage
- Update testing scripts based on findings
- Expand test suites as capabilities improve
