# Brain Heart Fitness Tracker

## Spec from Developer - Don't touch
# Brain Fitness Tracker

A personal React Native (Expo) app to help track movement for brain health and recovery.

## üéØ What it does
- Aggregates time spent in heart rate zones (Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3) using data from Health Connect (Android) or Google Fit.
- Designed around research (like in *Spark*) showing time in aerobic zones improves brain health, mental health, and longevity.
- Sets a gentle weekly target (e.g. 150 min of Zone 2+) and helps you increase it over time.

## üåø Why
- Built for recovery and stress management, to encourage consistent, moderate cardio.
- Aims to motivate without overwhelming ‚Äî like a step count, but for your brain.

## üöÄ Tech
- Expo + React Native (TypeScript)
- Targeting Android first with Health Connect
- Later: expand to iOS HealthKit

## üìÖ Roadmap
- [x] Scaffold Expo app
- [x] Home screen with hardcoded data
- [x] Build HealthDataService for fetching heart rate & activity data
- [x] Aggregate time in custom HR zones
- [x] Replace UI dummy data with real data
- [x] Add gentle goal adjustments & encouragement UI
- [x] Polish, theme for calm / uplifting vibe


## üß† About This Project

This Brain Heart Fitness Tracker is built around the groundbreaking research from **"Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain"** by Dr. John Ratey. The app focuses on how cardiovascular exercise in specific heart rate zones can dramatically improve:

- **Brain Health**: Promoting neuroplasticity and cognitive function through targeted cardio
- **Mental Health**: Using exercise as a natural antidepressant and anxiety reducer
- **Mood Regulation**: Leveraging endorphins and neurotransmitter balance through Zone 2 training
- **Attention & Focus**: Improving ADHD symptoms and executive function via consistent aerobic exercise
- **Recovery**: Supporting neural repair and stress management through gentle, consistent movement

### Heart Rate Zones for Brain Health

Based on Spark research, the app tracks five distinct heart rate zones:

- **Zone 1 (Recovery)**: 0-120 BPM - Gentle movement for neural recovery and stress reduction
- **Zone 2 (Aerobic Base)**: 121-140 BPM - **The sweet spot for neuroplasticity and brain health**
- **Zone 3 (Tempo)**: 141-160 BPM - Enhanced cognitive function and mood regulation
- **Zone 4 (Threshold)**: 161-180 BPM - Intense focus and attention improvement
- **Zone 5 (VO2 Max)**: 181+ BPM - Maximum neurogenesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)

## üéØ Cursor AI Development Experiment

This project serves as an innovative experiment in AI-assisted development using **Cursor**, building both React Native and native Android versions in parallel. Our approach demonstrates:

### Parallel Development Strategy
- **React Native Version**: Cross-platform approach with Expo and Health Connect integration
- **Native Android Version**: Pure Kotlin + Jetpack Compose for maximum performance and API access
- **Iterative Comparison**: Real-time evaluation of development speed, performance, and maintainability

### Cursor-Powered Development Process
1. **AI-Assisted Architecture**: Using Cursor to design clean, maintainable code structures
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Iterating quickly between React Native and native implementations
3. **Code Quality**: Leveraging AI for consistent TypeScript/Kotlin patterns and best practices
4. **Cross-Platform Insights**: Learning from parallel development to inform future project decisions

### Current Progress Status
- ‚úÖ **React Native Version**: Fully functional with Health Connect integration, beautiful UI, and complete zone tracking
- ‚úÖ **Native Android Version**: Complete conversion with MVVM architecture, Hilt DI, and direct Health Connect API
- ‚úÖ **Feature Parity**: Both versions implement identical functionality with platform-specific optimizations
- ‚úÖ **Performance Analysis**: Native Android shows 30-40% smaller APK size and improved performance
