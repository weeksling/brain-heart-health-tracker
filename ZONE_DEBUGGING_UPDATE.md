# Brain Heart Fitness Tracker - Zone Debugging Update

## Overview
Updated the Brain Heart Fitness Tracker app to fix zone distribution issues and added comprehensive debugging capabilities to inspect raw Health Connect data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Heart Rate Zone Adjustments
**Problem**: All minutes were falling into Zone 1 (0-120 BPM), suggesting heart rate data might be very low or missing.

**Solution**: Added a new Zone 0 for testing purposes and adjusted Zone 1 range:
- **Zone 0**: 0-94 BPM (Testing/Rest) - Gray color
- **Zone 1**: 95-120 BPM (Recovery) - Green color  
- **Zone 2**: 121-140 BPM (Aerobic Base) - Blue color
- **Zone 3**: 141-160 BPM (Tempo) - Orange color
- **Zone 4**: 161-180 BPM (Threshold) - Red color
- **Zone 5**: 181+ BPM (VO2 Max) - Purple color

### 2. Debug Data Inspection Feature
**Problem**: Need to see the actual raw data response from Health Connect to understand why zones aren't being populated correctly.

**Solution**: Added a debug button (üîç) on the Explore screen that shows:
- Raw Heart Rate Data (records, samples, BPM values, timestamps)
- Raw Steps Data (records, counts, timestamps)
- Data summaries and statistics
- Time ranges and record counts

### 3. Technical Implementation Details

#### Files Modified:
1. **`HeartRateZone.kt`**
   - Added Zone 0 (0-94 BPM) with gray color
   - Changed Zone 1 from 0-120 to 95-120 BPM
   - Updated all zone processing to include Zone 0

2. **`HealthDataRepository.kt`**
   - Updated zone calculations to include Zone 0
   - Added Zone 0 to fallback data generation
   - Updated progress calculations to handle new zone structure

3. **`ExploreViewModel.kt`**
   - Added `HealthConnectManager` dependency
   - Added `getRawDataDebugInfo()` method
   - Added `loadRawDataDebugInfo()` private method
   - Updated `ExploreUiState` to include debug info

4. **`ExploreScreen.kt`**
   - Added debug button (üîç) next to refresh button
   - Added full-screen debug dialog with scrollable content
   - Added monospace font for raw data display
   - Added proper dialog dismiss functionality

#### Features Added:
- **Debug Dialog**: Full-screen popup showing raw Health Connect data
- **Data Inspection**: Shows first 10 heart rate records with up to 5 samples each
- **Statistics**: Shows total records, samples, steps, and heart rate ranges
- **Time Range**: Shows exactly what data is being requested
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### 4. Testing and Validation
- ‚úÖ **Build Success**: App compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ **Zone Structure**: All 6 zones (0-5) properly defined
- ‚úÖ **Debug UI**: Debug button and popup dialog implemented
- ‚úÖ **Data Processing**: Repository handles new zone structure
- ‚úÖ **APK Generated**: Updated APK created successfully

## Debug Usage Instructions
1. Open the app and navigate to the **Explore** screen
2. Tap the **üîç (magnifying glass)** button in the top-right corner
3. View the raw Health Connect data in the popup dialog
4. Scroll through the data to see:
   - Heart rate records and samples
   - Steps data
   - Time ranges
   - Data summaries
5. Close the dialog with the **‚ùå** button

## Expected Outcomes
- **Zone 0**: Should capture any very low heart rate readings (0-94 BPM)
- **Zone 1**: Should capture typical resting heart rates (95-120 BPM)
- **Debug Info**: Should reveal the actual BPM values being returned from Health Connect
- **Problem Diagnosis**: Debug data will show if heart rate data is missing, malformed, or consistently low

## Files Generated
- `BrainHeartFitness-v1.0.1-debug-updated.apk` - Updated APK with zone fixes and debug features
- `ZONE_DEBUGGING_UPDATE.md` - This documentation file

## Next Steps
1. Install the updated APK on a device
2. Use the debug feature to inspect actual Health Connect data
3. Check if heart rate readings are:
   - Missing entirely
   - Consistently below 95 BPM
   - Malformed or incorrectly processed
4. Based on debug findings, further adjustments can be made to data processing logic

This update provides both a potential fix for the zone distribution issue and the diagnostic tools needed to understand exactly what's happening with the Health Connect data.
