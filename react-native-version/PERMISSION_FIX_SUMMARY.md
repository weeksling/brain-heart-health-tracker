# Permission Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Expo Go Detection**: The app now properly detects when running in Expo Go
2. **Graceful Fallback**: When Health Connect is not available (in Expo Go), the app automatically uses simulated data
3. **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear alerts inform users about the limitations in Expo Go
4. **No Crashes**: The app no longer crashes when permissions can't be requested

## Key Changes Made

### 1. HealthDataService.ts
- Removed dependency on `expo-constants`
- Added try-catch around `getSdkStatus()` to detect Expo Go environment
- When Health Connect SDK is not available, the service automatically returns success and uses dummy data

### 2. app/(tabs)/index.tsx  
- Simplified permission handling logic
- Removed complex permission state management
- Added clear user messaging when running in Expo Go
- Better error handling for various scenarios

### 3. app.json
- Added proper Health Connect plugin configuration
- Added iOS health permissions (for future compatibility)
- Configured Android permissions correctly

## How It Works Now

1. **In Expo Go**:
   - Health Connect SDK calls fail gracefully
   - Service automatically switches to dummy data mode
   - User sees a one-time alert explaining the limitation
   - App continues working with simulated data

2. **In Production Build**:
   - Health Connect initializes normally
   - Permissions are requested properly
   - Real health data is used

## Testing

1. Run `npm start` to start the development server
2. Open the app in Expo Go
3. You should see:
   - An initial alert about using simulated data
   - The app working normally with dummy heart rate data
   - Ability to switch between Daily/Weekly views
   - No crashes or permission errors

## Next Steps for Production

To use real health data:
1. Install EAS CLI: `npm install -g eas-cli`
2. Configure build: `eas build:configure`
3. Build APK: `eas build -p android --profile preview`
4. Install on device with Health Connect
